Hello Github! My name is Adam. I was currently working for GlobalLogic. I studied informatics at Technical University of Košice in Slovakia.   

I’m interested in helping out small projects to see how it goes. Just to gasp situation on github, also learning something new is always a plus.

I’m looking to collaborate on projects involving Java and/or Javascript but also, I dont have a problem helping out projects in other programming languages. I want to give this comunity something back, since it helped me trough my first and second collage years.
