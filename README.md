Hello Github! My name is Adam. I am currently studying informatics at Technical University of Košice, Slovakia.   

I’m interested in helping out small projects to see how it goes. Just to gasp situation on github, also learning something new is always a plus.

I’m looking to collaborate on projects involving Java and/or Javascript. I want to give this comunity something back, since it helped me trough my first and second collage years.
